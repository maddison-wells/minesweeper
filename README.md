# Minesweeper

## Minesweeper Game
Welcome to the Minesweeper game! This is a Java implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, where you clear the board without detonating any mines.

## How to Play
Objective: Clear the board without detonating any mines. If you uncover a mine, you lose the game.

## Board Layout: The game board consists of a grid of squares. Each square can be in one of the following states:

## Unrevealed: [ ]
## Revealed: [0]-[9]
## Mine: [m]

## Enter the X and Y coordinates of the square you want to uncover.
Use the revealed numbers to deduce the locations of mines and safely clear the board.

You win the game by revealing all squares except the ones containing mines.
You lose the game if you uncover a square containing a mine.

## Additional Notes
The game board is a grid of size 10x10 by default, with 10 randomly placed mines.
You can customize the board size and number of mines by modifying the code in the Main class.
